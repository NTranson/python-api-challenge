## Python API Challenge
Reuploaded the repo as changes did not push on my initial upload. 

In this challenge, city & weather data were pulled using API calls. My API keys are embedded within a .gitignore file. In WeatherPY, the data was analyzed to determine any regressions between several variables including longitude, latitude, wind speed, humidity, and more. In Vacation PY,  we plot spective cities and used GeoApify to find and create a map of the hotels closest to their respective cities.
